; Instapaper tokens are normally created through the web UI onboarding flow
; (description + username/password exchange). Leave this section commented
; out unless you need an offline fallback for token migration. If present and
; tokens are missing in credentials.json under instapaper_id, the worker will
; exchange email/password for OAuth tokens, store them, then remove this
; section from your INI.
